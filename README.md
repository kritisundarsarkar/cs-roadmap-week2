# Week 2 â€“ Git & GitHub Basics

This is my first Git-tracked project for the AI + Cloud + Data Science roadmap.

### File:
- `welcome_script.py`: A simple script that asks for name and age, then tells you your age next year.

This project helped me:
- Learn Git initialization, commit, and push
- Configure Git identity
- Push code to a real GitHub repo

# cs-roadmap-week2

A Python CLI tool that takes your name and age as arguments, and predicts your age next year. Also includes a sample Bash script.

## Features

- Accepts command-line flags (--name, --age)
- Clean function-based code structure
- Easy to extend for new features
- Demonstrates Git branching and merging
- Includes basic Bash automation

## Usage

```bash
python welcome_cli.py --name Kriti --age 19
