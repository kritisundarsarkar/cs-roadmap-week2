# Week 2 â€“ Git & GitHub Basics

This is my first Git-tracked project for the AI + Cloud + Data Science roadmap.

### File:
- `welcome_script.py`: A simple script that asks for name and age, then tells you your age next year.

This project helped me:
- Learn Git initialization, commit, and push
- Configure Git identity
- Push code to a real GitHub repo
